          <p>Hey, did you hear about the upcoming event at the CCS department of our University? They're organizing CS
            DAYS: A
            Digital Day Off, and it's going to be a blast! It's happening from April 24 to 26, and we're all invited
            to
            take a break
            from our boring lectures and dive into some exciting activities. <br><br>

            The event is packed with fun and games. We'll be having mini intramurals, friendly competitions, cultural
            nights, and a
            banging party that you wouldn't want to miss. From basketball to volleyball, we've got outdoor games for
            all
            the sports
            enthusiasts. And, if you're not into sports, you can show off your talent in the cultural night by
            performing skits,
            dances, songs, and others that you're best at. The three-day event is going to be lit, and I can't wait to
            join
            the party. <br><br>

            To spice things up, the organizers have randomly assigned everyone into six teams based on their year
            level,
            ranging
            from first-year to fourth-year students. It's going to be a fierce competition, and the team with the
            highest score will
            be declared the winner. I'm excited to know which team I'll be in and which team will come out as the
            champion. All in
            all, CS DAYS: A Digital Day Off is the perfect opportunity for us to take a break from our academic
            routine,
            bond with
            our classmates, and create memories that we'll cherish for a long time. So, mark your calendars and get
            ready to have
            some fun!
